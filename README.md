# anchor-algo-geometry-stack

`anchor-algo-geometry-stack` is a OCaml project for Algorithms. It turns package an OCaml local lab for geometry analysis with transition tables, invalid-transition tests, and documented operating limits into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Anchor Algo Geometry Stack

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

The goal is to capture the core behavior in code and make the surrounding assumptions obvious. A reader should be able to run the verifier, open the fixtures, and understand why each decision was made.

## Design Sketch

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The OCaml implementation keeps the data record and functions small enough to load directly in the test file.

## Fixture Notes

`pressure` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `review` path with a score of 66. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at -37 and `recovery` at 236, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## What It Does

- Uses fixture data to keep complexity tradeoffs changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for golden cases, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents boundary checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Setup

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Limits

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.

## Next Directions

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more algorithms fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
